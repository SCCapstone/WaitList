Login for admin page

password: asdfasdf


NOTIFICATION WHEN TESTING:

This app will currently only send text notifications to one phone(Cory Redmond). This is because the SMS API only allows one phone number to be used for SMS in their free trial plan for testing purposes. If necessary we can purchase a full plan to allow any phone to send/receive SMS messages from the Twilio API.

If you need to test this application, please contact either either Cory Redmond (redmonc2@email.sc.edu) or Eddie Pace (paceea@email.sc.edu) member and we will deploy it. We do not keep it deployed all the time because we pay by the hour for it to be up

For testing the "fogot password" function. Send us one of your emails and we will change the admin account email to match it. The password will remain "asdfasdf". This web application only uses one account as per clients request.
